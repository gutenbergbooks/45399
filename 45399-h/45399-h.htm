<h2>THE MINISTER OF FINE ARTS.</h2>

<p class="title1">(<i>From a Newspaper of the Future.</i>)</p>

<p>Many years ago, in 1895, our esteemed contemporary, the <i>Daily
Graphic</i>, suggested the appointment of a Minister of Fine Arts.
This seemingly admirable scheme was soon after carried out. The
first Minister was a cautious man. His one great improvement,
which met with universal approval, was to remove all the statues
and fountains from every part of London, and to place them in a row
on Romney Marsh, from Dungeness to Hythe, where they would
undoubtedly scare away any French army endeavouring to land.
The second Minister tried to introduce the so-called "Queen Anne,"
or Dutch architecture, and prepared a scheme for altering the whole
of London. As a beginning, the north side of Oxford Street, from
Holborn to the Marble Arch, was completely transformed. Along
the whole distance stretched a fantastic row of red-brick buildings,
the surface of which was diversified at every possible point by useless
little windows, and little arches, and little projections, and little
recesses, and little balustrades. These had risen to the level of the
second floors, when a change of Government brought in a Minister
who believed only in English architecture of the fifteenth century.
Under his directions the new buildings were therefore continued in
stone, in imitation of the Houses of Parliament, but the work was
stopped by his death. His successor, though of course one of the
Gothic party, preferred the Gothic architecture of Italy, and the
upper parts of the houses were therefore finished in that style.
As at that time the reduction of the Budget was urgently needed,
it was decided to use painted stucco instead of real marble, as in
Italy.</p>

<p>When the next Government came into office all the houses on the
South side of Oxford Street were pulled down, and everyone said
that at last we should have an imposing row of buildings. Unfortunately
a difficulty arose. The new Minister of Fine Arts was
only interested in gardening, and hardly knew one style of architecture
from another. He could not therefore decide the great
question whether the new houses should correspond with the opposite
ones, and, if so, whether they should be "Queen Anne," or Italian
Gothic, or English Perpendicular in style. The controversy raged
for months. Every person interested said, or wrote, what he
thought, or knew, or did not think, or did not know, about architecture,
and taste, and art in general. The Academy of Arts, the
Society of Antiquaries, and the Institute of Architects, hitherto
sedate bodies, became so excited that free fights occurred almost daily
in the neighbourhood of Burlington House, and on the waste land in
Oxford Street. In every newspaper "The Improvement of Oxford
Street" was discussed vigorously. Suddenly the current of public
opinion was turned in another direction by a lamentable event. The
Minister of Fine Arts, returning from his weekly inspection of the
maiden-hair ferns on Wormwood Scrubs, was killed in a cab accident
in Vigo Street, a miserably narrow turning, which had escaped the
notice of everyone but the cabmen, who always prefer the narrowest
streets.</p>

<p>At once there arose a universal cry that safety and space were more
important than style. The new Minister was beginning to widen
some of the narrow thoroughfares, when his party went out of office.
The work has not been continued by the present Minister, who is
considering a scheme for the improvement of London by the erection
of fountains and statues. Meanwhile the Oxford Street site is still
vacant, and no improvements are attempted elsewhere. Half of
Vigo Street has been made the same width as Burlington Gardens;
the other half remains, as before, about fifteen feet across from
house to house.</p>

<p>Our esteemed contemporary, the <i>Daily Graphic</i>, always alive to
the artistic needs of the age, remarks that it is impossible to regulate
art by Acts of Parliament, or to improve London by party government,
and therefore suggests that the Ministry of Fine Arts should
be abolished.</p>

<h2>SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">Board and Residence.</span>&mdash;Here is a gem from the Bandon Quarter
Sessions. Their Medical Officer of Health, Dr. <span class="sc">Magner</span>, was suing
the Guardians of the Clonakilty Union for failing to erect a fence
round the Dispensary residence:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
Counsel argued that the true cause of all this was that Dr. <span class="sc">Magner</span>
happened to be a gentleman of independent mind, who had not, like others
in the same position, the <i>savoir faire</i> to cuddle guardians.</p>

<p><i>His Honour.</i> Do you mean to say that any unfortunate medical officer has
to cuddle boards of guardians? A very unpleasant duty certainly.</p>

<p><i>Mr. Powell.</i> Well, they had to attend the meetings, and, perhaps, stand
drinks, and things of that kind. (<i>Laughter.</i>)
</p></blockquote>

<div class="poem width24">  <div class="stanza">
<p>Who would not be such a Medical Officer,</p>
<p class="i2">Practised in keeping his Board well in hand?</p>
<p>D'you think that he offers them cocoa or coffee, Sir?</p>
<p class="i2">No; but it's whisky he's called on to "stand."</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Paupers fall ill, and his task is to cure 'em;</p>
<p class="i2">In fights with infection he comes up to time;</p>
<p>'Gainst bad sanitation he's paid to secure 'em;</p>
<p class="i2">His drains may be poor, but his "drinks" must be prime.</p>
  </div><div class="stanza">
<p>Is any Guardian cantankerous? He "cuddles" him</p>
<p class="i2">(So did a Counsel obscurely declare);</p>
<p>And should this fail, then his "Irish hot" fuddles him;</p>
<p class="i2">For what is a doctor without "<i>savoir faire</i>"?</p>

<p><span class="sc">The Water-Bandits again!</span>&mdash;Not content with spoiling the
Falls of Foyers, the Aluminium Company now threatens an attack
on the Falls of Clyde. Oh, what a Fall is there, my countrymen!
exclaims the patriotic Scot. The Co. that dares to lay its hands on
Clyde, save in the way of kindness, is a willun, and should be wound
up instanter. Says the <i>North British Daily Mail</i>&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
The times are distinctly utilitarian and prosaic, and yet we have not all
progressed up, or down, to the level of the man who sees nothing in a grand
cataract beyond so much horse-power running to waste.
</p></blockquote>

<p>Neatly put, and even from a utilitarian standpoint it may be well
to remember that as much money may be brought into Scotland by a
thousand tourists wanting to view the Falls, as by a single company
wanting to ruin them.</p>

<h2>LETTERS FROM A FIANCÉE.</h2>

<p><span class="sc">My dear Marjorie</span>,&mdash;Since I wrote to
you last, <span class="sc">Arthur</span> has developed unmistakable
signs of acute jealousy. <i>Bluebeard</i>
was mild in comparison with him; <i>Othello</i>
childishly unsuspicious. At first, I liked it,
and was flattered; but it is now beginning to
be a little wearing. Also, I find that it has
the effect of making me ridiculously and
unjustifiably vain; catching, as it were, from
<span class="sc">Arthur</span>, the idea that everyone I meet must
necessarily admire me, and would like to take
his place. A quite absurd instance of this has
just happened, of which I am rather ashamed.
My cousin <span class="sc">Freddy</span>, who is staying with us
in the country, has a musical friend, called
<span class="sc">Percival</span>, for whose talents and accomplishments
<span class="sc">Freddy</span> has the greatest possible admiration.
Having got permission to bring
him down, <span class="sc">Freddy</span> instantly dragged him to
the piano and insisted on his playing and
singing a song which went like this:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width15">  <div class="stanza">
<p>"The people call me <span class="sc">Daisy</span>,</p>
<p>Little <span class="sc">Daisy</span>, with the dimple,</p>
<p>And all the boys are fond of me</p>
<p>Because I am so simple," &amp;c.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p>We were all charmed, except <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, and
except <span class="sc">Percival</span> himself. <span class="sc">Percival</span> composes
songs, called "<i>Dreaming Eyes</i>," "<i>Far
from Thee</i>," "<i>Ever</i>"; besides, he can play
<span class="sc">Wagner</span>, and <span class="sc">Mascagni</span>, and <span class="sc">Tosti</span>, and all
kinds of real classical music, and didn't quite
like to be treated as if he were a mere music-hall
singer. He is a gentle, amiable creature,
without any pose, and with (as I know <i>now</i>)
not the very smallest intention or desire to
steal the heart of one who belonged to another.
It would be difficult to find anyone less likely
than <span class="sc">Percival</span> to break up&mdash;let us say, for
instance, a happy English home. <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
thought otherwise; to <span class="sc">Arthur</span>, <span class="sc">Percival</span>
seemed a <i>Don Juan</i>, a gay <i>Lothario</i>, a very
<i>Lovelace</i>, the most dangerous of young troubadours.
And he glared&mdash;really, glared is
the only word&mdash;so much while I talked to
poor young <span class="sc">Percival</span> that I, also, actually
began to think there must be something in
it; and, from mischief, I talked to him the
more. After dinner, we danced. To tease
<span class="sc">Arthur</span>, who was snubbing everyone and
looking sulky, I couldn't resist sitting in the
conservatory a little while with <span class="sc">Freddy's</span>
friend. True, my conversation with this
reckless <i>Rizzio</i> might have been, word for
word, carried on between two provincial old
ladies: and yet, the knowledge that <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
wouldn't have believed it, gave a sort of
imaginary romantic wickedness to the whole
thing. He asked me if I had read <i>Trilby</i>,
and said he had, curiously enough, never
seen the <i>Shop Girl</i>. We agreed, that though
we didn't much like the winter, still it was
certainly a nice change after the summer.
We had reached this point, when <span class="sc">Arthur</span>
came into the conservatory; I rose, so did
<span class="sc">Percival</span>, and at the same time he handed
me a little piece of paper on which he had,
while he talked, been writing something in
pencil.... I walked away with <span class="sc">Arthur</span>,
mechanically squeezing the little bit of paper
in my hand.</p>

<p>"What," he said, furiously, "was that
letter that young fool gave you?"</p>

<p>Becoming frightened, I denied that he had
given me a letter, slipped it into my mouth,
and slowly ate it.... We had a scene. I
cried; we made it up, and he gave me a new
brooch afterwards.</p>

<p>The next day I seized an opportunity to
tell <span class="sc">Percival</span> that he <i>mustn't</i> do such things,
as it made <span class="sc">Arthur</span> very angry, and also to
ask what was on the piece of paper. He
looked at me. "Why, Miss <span class="sc">Gladys</span>," he
said, "didn't you show it to your future
husband?"</p>

<p>"What was it?" I asked, timidly.</p>

<p>"It was my publisher's address. You said
you would like to have some of my songs,
and&mdash;&mdash;" Thank heaven, he has gone away
now, and as <span class="sc">Freddy</span> is always cycling, there
is peace again.</p>

<p>But advise me what to do about <span class="sc">Arthur</span>.</p>

romance: all "movement": interest

excursions: obstacles everywhere only
to be surmounted: dramatic finish and
final tableau magnificent! Curtain:
loud applause: and calls for author.
Great success.</p>

<p>Hugely content is the Baron with a
book published by <span class="sc">Smith, Elder &amp; Co.</span>,
and writ by one "<span class="sc">Jack Easel</span>," some
time a frequent contributor to <i>Mr.
Punch's</i> pages. The title of the work
is "<i>Our Square and Circle</i>." All is
written "on the square," and that the
matter is "non-contentious" is evident, as otherwise the author
would be "arguing in a circle," which is absurd; or "in a vicious
circle," which would of course utterly take away the reputation of
his quiet square for eminent respectability. That it is pleasantly
written, the reader will find out for himself; that it was a labour of
love, and therefore Easel-y writ, goes without saying. The Baron
joins issue with him on certain details as to the table, the wines, and
dinners generally; though up to now he should have thought himself
at one with him [or "at 7.45 with him," which is the more likely
hour] on all such important points. The Baron gives the book his
"Imprimatur," says "Pass <span class="sc">Jack Easel</span>," and is the author's and

<h2>PLEASURE AND PROFIT.</h2>

<p class="center1c">[It has recently been suggested in the <i>Author</i> that novelists should take
the management of their books entirely into their own hands.]</p>

<p>Happening to call lately on my friend <span class="sc">Snooks</span>, the eminent
novelist, I was rather surprised at the change which had come over
the appearance of his drawing-room. The books, which had been
scattered over the table in former days, were now methodically
arranged along the shelves which covered the entire walls, and in
the corner, where a china cabinet had formerly stood, there now
figured a sort of counter, behind which stood <span class="sc">Snooks</span> himself,
arrayed in his shirt-sleeves.</p>

<p>"Ha!" he exclaimed, as I entered, "what can I have the pleasure
of showing you to-day? Romances, poetry, travels&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why, <span class="sc">Snooks</span>," I said, "don't you remember me? What on
earth are you doing?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Snooks's</span> face fell somewhat. "Oh, it's you, is it? I thought
it was a customer. You see that I've taken the <i>Author's</i> advice,
and am managing my own affairs."</p>

<p>"Indeed? And how in the world&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hush!" the novelist interrupted. "Here are some customers."
And as he spoke four or five people entered the drawing-room, and
marched up to the counter.</p>

<p>"A nice novel, Madam," said <span class="sc">Snooks</span>, just like one of Messrs.
<span class="sc">Marshall and Snelgrove's</span> young men. "Certainly. Kindly
step this way, please. Here is my <i>Love's Dilemma</i>, very sweet, I
assure you. Yes, only four-and-six cash. Thank you.... Can I
show you anything, Sir? This is in the latest style&mdash;<i>The Decree
Nisi</i>&mdash;or I could write you something to order, if you prefer it....
Hymns, Madam? No, I am afraid I've none in stock, would a
devotional sonnet do? Of course, I could make any number you
require at the shortest notice.... Thank you, seven-and-sixpence
change. They shall be delivered to-morrow morning. Evangelical,
I think you said?... To suit a young lady&mdash;<i>not</i> advanced?
Certainly, Sir; I can offer you my <i>Milk and Mayblossom</i>, published
at six shillings; reduced to half-a-crown.... You didn't like
<i>Murder and Sudden Death</i>, Sir? Well, I <i>am</i> surprised, it's one of
my favourite productions; but I can sell you a rather milder blend,
if you prefer it."</p>

<p>And so the conversation went on, until all the customers had been
satisfied, and <span class="sc">Snooks</span> wiped his heated brow and turned to me.
"There, you see how it works; splendid system, isn't it? No
trouble with publishers or booksellers, entirely a ready-money trade,
done over the counter in one's own drawing-room."</p>

<p>"Then all these books are your own work?" I asked.</p>

<p>"Of course; you don't suppose I'm fool enough to sell other
people's goods? Of course I keep a large ready-made stock, and
turn out others to order as required. And, as you're here, do just
buy&mdash;&mdash;" At this point I fled.</p>

<h2>SPORT PER WIRE.</h2>

<p class="center1">[An international revolver match by cable is arranged to take place shortly
between English and American teams.]</p>

<p>"Good morning," said a representative of <i>Mr. Punch</i> to the
Chief Umpire of a well-known Telegraphic Agency; "I have come
to ask if you would kindly favour me with some details of your
new Sporting Department."</p>

<p>"Certainly," he replied. "It has a great future before it. We
intend to revolutionise sport in all its branches."</p>

<p>"For instance?"</p>

<p>"Well, as it's in season, take Football. In fact, I've just
finished umpiring in an Association
match between England and America,
which, in my unofficial capacity, I'm
happy to say we've won&mdash;for a change."</p>

<p>"Where was it played?"</p>

<p>"Why, at this desk, of course. You
see, <i>we</i> cable over to the Associated Press
full particulars of the imaginary kick-off,
and they look it out in the Code&mdash;which
doesn't generally take more than
ten minutes&mdash;and wire back their return
kick (also imaginary), with name, age,
weight, and address of the kicker. This
is generally repeated as a security against
the risk of error. The charge for repetition
is one-half the charge for transmission,
any fraction of one penny less
than a halfpenny being reckoned as one
halfpenny, according to the admirable
wording of the Post Office rules."</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 180px;"><a href="images/209b-420.png"><img src="images/209b-180.png" width="180" height="274" alt="Football" /></a></div>

<p>"We wrangle for the rest of the time. This is quite in keeping
with the modern spirit of football, the game now having developed
into a kind of Hibernian debating society."</p>

<p>"But how was it you won to-day?"</p>

<p>"Oh, we had the last word before 'Time' was called, which enabled
our Sporting Editors to prove conclusively that the first kick scored a
goal, and was not 'offside.' Our American colleagues, however, have
appealed to the Central International Committee of Football Referees,
so that the wires will be kept warm for the next half-year on the
subject in the most sportsman-like manner."</p>

<p>"Capital! And have you any other telegraphic developments?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes! There's our Ladies Inter-Varsity Stay-at-Home Hockey
Contest&mdash;that's played over there in the corner every afternoon by
sixpenny telegram. The Dramatic and Novelist Editors attend to
that, in order to acquaint themselves with the workings of the feminine
mind. The Golf Department is in charge of the Scottish Editors.
They have an anxious time of it, as most of the language used is
not fit for transmission, and bunker them badly.... That's the
River Editor, hard at work in that arm-chair, rowing against Yale
by cable. And there you see our Racing Authority, busily engaged
over a Horseless Derby with the French Staff.... My Second-in-Command
is now arranging the Corbett-Fitzsimmons fight, which
will take place at last by telegraph on opposite sides of the Atlantic....
We do a bit of Comic Volunteer Man&oelig;uvres as well, but I'm
sorry to say that our Shouting Editor, whose idea of humour is somewhat
noisy, has just broken the telephone with one of his ejaculations....
But I must ask you to excuse me now, as I have a
billiard tournament, a yacht race, and a cricket match with all
Australia to manage simultaneously, and the spectators&mdash;I mean
newspaper readers&mdash;are getting impatient."</p>

<h2>THE MUSIC HALL AS OTHERS WOULD SEE IT.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>With compliments to those it may concern</i>)</p>

<p>The <i>entrepreneur</i> had conducted, the visitor
here, there, and everywhere. He had shown
the stage, the auditorium, and the tea and
cake-room. Every feature of the reformed
scheme had been duly explained.</p>

<p>"No singing allowed in the entertainment?"
queried the visitor.</p>

<p>"None at all," was the reply; "we consider
that music is a mistake. Of course
same songs are good, but as others are bad
it is better to prohibit them altogether, and
thus escape the risk of a mistaken choice."</p>

<p>"And no dancing?"</p>

<p>"Of course not. That would be entirely
contrary to our principles. If people require
exercise they can walk or run."</p>

<p>"But how about the poetry of motion?
How about the grace of movement?"</p>

<p>"We desire to have nothing to do with
either," returned the <i>entrepreneur</i>. "You
see our object is to have an entirely new
entertainment, and consequently we reject
all items, that have figured in other programmes."</p>

<p>"Well, well," murmured the visitor;
"you may be right. But I should like to
see the result. I will wait until the performance
is given, and judge for myself."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot assist you to carry
out this scheme," declared the Manager of
the Progressive Music Hall, "because we are
not going to have an entertainment."</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Of course it won't be
an entertainment in the usual sense of the
word. It can't naturally be an entertainment&mdash;I
should have said a performance."</p>

<p>"But we give neither entertainment nor
performance."</p>

<h2>ANOTHER CONFERENCE OF WOMEN WORKERS.</h2>

<p class="center">(<i>Not held at Nottingham.</i>)</p>

<blockquote><p>
<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>The garish but unsavoury "Saloon Bar" of a "South-side
Pub." A group of "Daughters of Toil" sipping and gossiping.</i>
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Laundress</i> (<i>throwing down newspaper</i>). Wot's this 'ere National
Union of Women Workers there's so much cackle about?</p>

<p><i>Step Girl</i> (<i>sullenly</i>). Dunno, I'm sure. <i>We</i>'re not in it,
anyhow.</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Ho no! <i>We</i> ain't women workers, I suppose,
<i>we</i> ain't!</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> Then I should like ter know where they find 'em.
(<i>Sips "white satin" and sniffs.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Shop Girl</i> (<i>to Sempstress</i>). 'Ere Miss <span class="sc">Mivvins</span>, you're no
hand of a scholard, and know all erbout everythink. Wot <i>is</i> this Nottingham
Goose Fair, anyhow?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress.</i> Well, it is not a goose fair, exactly <span class="sc">Emma</span>&mdash;not in
the sense of the old song, at any rate. Seems to me it's a meeting of
ladies of title, who don't know what work is, to talk about women of
no title who have to do it. (<i>Sighs.</i>) But I suppose they mean well,
poor dears.</p>

<p><i>Young Machinist</i> (<i>pallid and cramped</i>). Well, Miss <span class="sc">Mivvins</span>,
no doubt as they do. But oh dear me, what good are they going to
do the likes of us? My knees crackle, my back aches, and my head
swims. Thanks, yes, I don't mind if I do. (<i>Drinks.</i>) Ah! that
warms and straightens one out a bit! But if, as you say, these
ladies don't know what work is, one of 'em should do <i>my</i> little bit
at the warehouse for a week.</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> Ah! or mine, at the wash-tub.</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Or mine at the wash-tub <i>and</i> all over the shop
as well, as I 'olds is the 'ardest of all, seeing as how it ain't <i>never</i>
done.</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>mildly</i>). Ah, yes; but you have <i>your</i> husband and
children for company, whereas I&mdash;&mdash;Oh, the long, dreary loneliness
of it!</p>

<p><i>Tailoress.</i> Lookee 'ere, Liz, don't you talk about the old man
being <i>cumpny</i>, not till you know wot sich "cumpny" is. <i>You</i>
never got a black heye like this; and do you 'appen to know
'ow a kick from a 'obnailed 'ighlow feels in the ribs?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>gently</i>). Well, no, my poor soul; and perhaps
I'm ungrateful to grumble.</p>

<p><i>Flower Mounter.</i> Yes; but what might these topping
Nottingham Lydy-Workers talk about when they <i>do</i> meet?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress.</i> Well, you see&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> 'Old 'ard a minnit, <span class="sc">Liz</span>. Before you begin,
let's drink up and 'ave another all round. Torkin' 's dry
work, as I dessay the Nottingham spouters found it.</p>

<p class="rindent">[<i>They toss off, and replenish.</i></p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>continuing</i>). Well, I see, one of their papers
is on "The Ethics of Work."</p>

<p><i>Step Girl.</i> Lor! wot's that, Miss <span class="sc">Mivvins</span>?</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>hesitating</i>). Well&mdash;you see&mdash;I suppose it
means the <i>morals</i> of work, or something o' that.</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> <i>Morals</i> of work! Might as well talk o' the
morals of misery while you 're erbout it. The less I 'ave to
do, the better I like it&mdash;that's <i>my</i> moral.</p>

<p><i>Shop Girl.</i> Not much morals about work nowadays,
<span class="sc">Sarah</span>, if <i>I</i>'m any judge. Piling up work and cutting down
prices, with the halternative of the streets if yer strikes&mdash;that's
about the "morals" of <i>our</i> firm. And if you torked to
our Boss about these 'ere Nottingham notions, <i>'e</i>'d "moral"
you!</p>

<p><i>Semptress.</i> Another lady, I see, with <i>such</i> a pretty, poetic-like
sort of name, talks about "The Responsibility of Refinement."</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Ah, well, we ain't got none, so that
can't consarn us, can it?</p>

<p><i>Shop Girl</i> (<i>tartly</i>). I say, you speak for yerself, Mother
<span class="sc">Matthews</span>. Of course, that means refinement in <i>dress</i>,
and&mdash;well we don't <i>all</i> wear a pancake 'at with a 'aporth
o' green feathers dobbed on to it! (<i>Sniffs, and adjusts
her own "high-up" hat with ambitious "hortridge"
plumes.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife</i> (<i>sharply</i>). Now look you 'ere, Miss
<span class="sc">Stuckup</span>, if I 'adn't more "refinement" in my little finger
than wot you 'ave in your 'ole five foot nothink, my old
man 'ud swop me off for a ragman's black doll, 'e would, so
there!</p>

<p><i>Voice from the Bar.</i> Now then lydies, a <i>leetle</i> less noise
there <i>if</i> you please!</p>

<p><i>Sempstress.</i> I see here's another talks of "Home Life,"
and another of the "Morals of Money Spending."</p>

<p><i>Workman's Wife.</i> Haw! haw! haw! Morals o' money
spending, indeed! If these 'ere torky lydies 'ad got as little
money to spend as <i>we</i> 'ave, and as many mouths to fill with
it, 'tisn't the <i>morals</i> on it as 'ud trouble 'em. When the
wealthy 'uns begin to patter of morals to us poor trash, they mostly
mean <i>meanness</i>, I reckon.</p>

<p><i>Young Machinist.</i> Right you are, Mrs. <span class="sc">Matthews</span>!</p>

<p><i>Sempstress</i> (<i>sadly</i>). And as to "Home Life,"&mdash;ah! how many of
them know that to some of us it only means a painful "Home
<i>Death</i>?"</p>

<p><i>Laundress.</i> Oh, come, I sy, Miss <span class="sc">Mivvens</span>, you'll give us all the
'orrors if you tork like that! While there's life&mdash;<i>and</i> liquor&mdash;there's

then we must see about&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sempstress.</i> "Home Life" and the "Ethics of Work" again, as

<h2>"THE 'PINERIAN' SPRING" AT THE COMEDY.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 200px;"><a href="images/215a-800.png"><img src="images/215a-180.png" width="180" height="323" alt="Mr. P-n-ro (making up after the portrait of Ibsen)." /></a>
<p><i>Mr. P-n-ro</i> (<i>making up after the portrait of Ibsen</i>).
"Ah! I think I'm getting uncommonly like him."</p></div>

<p>Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> is temporarily Ibsenised. "<i>What will become of
them?</i>" should have been the sub-title, if not the single title, of his
new play at the "C. C. C.," or <span class="sc">Comyns Carr's</span> Comedy Theatre.
Instead of "<i>What will become of them?</i>" Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span>
calls it <i>The Benefit of the Doubt</i>, which is supposed to
be a quotation from the Judge's summing up in the Divorce Court
in the case of <i>Allingham</i> v. <i>Allingham</i>. <i>Mrs. Allingham</i>
has sued for a divorce in consequence of her husband's misconduct
with <i>Mrs. Fraser</i>; the misconduct was not proved, but the Judge was
so severe on the conduct of <i>Mrs. Fraser</i> that there is for
her, as far as her husband, friends, family, and Society generally are
concerned, no benefit whatever to be obtained from the existence of the
doubt in question. Such is the cheerful subject Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span>,
in Ibsenitish vein, has chosen, and he has
written a series of dramatic scenes artistically developing his
characters by the most natural dialogue possible, but not, as it
seems to me, by means either most natural, or most probable. The
great situation of the piece is brought about by a gentleman (in the
best sense of the word, as far as we can judge up to this point) permitting
his infernally jealous wife&mdash;there is no other epithet for her
except "infernally"&mdash;to conceal herself on purpose to overhear a
conversation between himself and her supposed rival! Analogous
situations in broad farce and farcical comedy are frequent and permissible:
but surely not in a drama of real life. But then, I remind
me, that this drama is Ibsenitish; which does make a difference.</p>

<p>The play is far too long, but it is admirably written and admirably
acted. The dramatist intends most of his leading characters to be
repulsively sordid, vulgar, and selfish, and those who are not so are
amiable, but weak. The first heroine, perfectly played by Miss
<span class="sc">Winifrid Emery</span>, is a fast member of a fast family as badly
brought up as <i>La famille Benoîton</i>, the vain, frivolous mother
being well portrayed by Miss <span class="sc">Lindley</span>; and the second heroine,
admirably represented by Miss <span class="sc">Lily Hanbury</span>, is simply an odious,
jealous shrew, and the prospect of happiness in a "place unmentionable
to ears polite" would be more probable than any happiness for a
husband with a wife like this. With neither heroine is sympathy
possible. Another splendid comedy performance is that of Miss
<span class="sc">Rose Leclercq</span>, as the Bishop's wife, a character whose original is
to be found in <span class="sc">Anthony Trollope's</span> <i>Barchester Towers</i>, from
which I will quote a specimen passage, and ask those who have seen
<i>The Benefit of the Doubt</i> whether it does not sum up in brief Mr.
<span class="sc">Pinero's</span> characters of <i>Mrs. Cloys</i> and her husband the Bishop:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>
"What did you say about it, Bishop?" asks <i>Mrs. Proudie</i> of her husband.</p>

<p>"Why," replies "her little man," "I said that I thought that if, that is,
should I&mdash;should the dean die&mdash;that is, I said I thought&mdash;&mdash;" As he went
on stammering and floundering, he saw that his wife's eye was fixed sternly
on him.
</p></blockquote>

<div class="figright" style="width: 150px;"><a href="images/215b-540.png"><img src="images/215b-130.png" width="130" height="343" alt="'Bedad then, 'tis Misther Shawn Allingham!'" /></a>
<p>"Bedad then, 'tis Misther Shawn Allingham!"</p></div>

<p>And these, with the stage directions, are the <i>Right Rev. Dr.
Cloys</i> and <i>Mrs. Cloys</i> of "St. Olpherts," and not of
"Barchester"&mdash;that's
all. And this <i>Mrs. Proudie-Cloys</i> serves as a <i>Dea ex
machinâ</i> coming forward to offer temporary relief to the hard,
austere husband <i>Mr. Fraser</i> (also a good performance by Mr. <span class="sc">J. G.
Grahame</span>), from his very trying wife. The Bishop is, oddly enough,
a mere "lay" figure; and is "left till called for" at the last moment.</p>

<p>Having already said that the acting all round is of first-class
quality, it will be superfluous to single out Mr. <span class="sc">Leonard Boyne</span> for
special praise. Yet he deserves it. Had the author given this
character an Irish title, the combination would have been perfect.
Mr. <span class="sc">Cyril Maude</span>, as the fussy, empty-headed M.P., adds another
finished picture to his eccentric portraitures; but Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> might
have refrained from adding to this personage's eccentricities one
which originated with Mr. <span class="sc">Charles Wyndham's</span> <i>Headless Man</i>,
whose system of <i>memoria technica</i>,
and recalling things by initial letters, Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> seems
to have borrowed, in order to complete <i>Sir Fletcher Portwood's</i>
equipment for the stage. It is as well to note this, lest
by unconscious cerebration Mr. <span class="sc">Pinero</span> should, in some future
piece, develope <i>Sir Fletcher</i> into another <i>Mr. Hedley</i>, and
refer to <i>Sir Fletcher</i> in this piece as his original.</p>

<p>The only pleasant scene is where, in the Second Act, two
club "pals," <i>Denzil Shafto</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">J. W. Pigott</span>) and <i>Peter
Elphick</i> (Mr. <span class="sc">Stuart Champion</span>) appear, the latter with a banjo;
both coming to cheer up their unhappy friend <i>Misther Allingham</i>.
These two lighten up the gloom of the Second Act for a
brief space, and then are heard no more; yet the scene in
which they strut their short ten minutes on the stage is
one of the best imagined, and best stage-managed as regards
"business," in a piece where every detail has been considered
and not a point lost. For acting, for dialogue, for character (granting
these to be what the author of their being has made them),
this unpleasant play ranks with the best of the dramas from,
what <i>Mrs. Malaprop</i> might term, "The Pinerian spring."
And the end? Nothing; a blank. The audience look at one
another and say, "Well&mdash;and then?... What next?" It
is a highly-finished play without a finish. It belongs to the
new order of dramas classified under the heading of the "The
Problem Play." Whether these will pay, or not, is another problem
of which the author and manager may find a satisfactory solution.</p>

<h2 class="sans">HOW KIPPER SLEW THE NEW FOREST HORNET.</h2>

<p class="title1"><span class="sc">Chapter II.</span>&mdash;<i>The Rescue.</i></p>

<p>For what length of time <span class="sc">Kipper</span> and the stagbeetle remained in
the unwonted positions described in the preceding chapter it would
be impossible to say without a stop-watch, which makes a good
repeater. However, it is certain that a couple of snails out for a
stroll, who saw the fall from the bottom of the heap, tried to come to
their help; but, owing to gout, they were unable to get more than half-way
up. A neighbouring mole heard the stagbeetle's smothered cries,
but, being blind, scuttled off in the wrong direction; while an old-fashioned
toad, who lived in a mud-bank just opposite, was aroused
from an afternoon nap, and, after peering out of his hole, declared that
it was no business of his. But then he was always hard-hearted,
and had made it a point never to interfere in the affairs of others
ever since he was out-voted in the
Zoological County Council on the
question as to whether tadpoles
should be recognised as young
frogs. He was opposed to the
measure, stating, in a powerful
speech, that inasmuch as a frog
had no tail, therefore a tadpole
could not be a frog. Being defeated,
he retired into private life,
and was, so report said, building a
home for destitute dormice, for he
was a person of considerable wealth.
But he was very mean, and a shrew
was heard to observe that the reason
he wished to take the dormice under
his protection was because they ate
nothing in the winter.</p>

<p>But while we are discussing
politics <span class="sc">Kipper</span> and the stagbeetle
are still in danger. Although the
stagbeetle kicked with all his
might he found that it only injured
his horns, and so, like many
other creatures not of a gambling
nature, lay still and trusted to
chance. As to <span class="sc">Kipper</span>, he was as motionless as a schoolboy's watch.
But about a quarter-of-an-hour after the accident a pretty young
maiden, named <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>, came tripping along the road. She was
not one of those girls who know that they are nice, because no one had
ever told her so, and she was too poor to afford a looking-glass.
But this did not prevent her from being good to all the inhabitants
of the forest, whether they had four legs, or two, or none at all, as
was the case with the snakes and blind worms. Yet the best of us
must have enemies, and she had incurred the anger of <span class="sc">Nippard</span>, the
great and poisonous hornet, whose only pleasure, like that of some
people who have guns, was to go out and kill something. <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>
had saved two lambs once from his murderous attacks by driving
them into an out-house, and <span class="sc">Nippard</span> had never forgotten or forgiven
the insult, and vowed vengeance. This he had carried out in
several ways. He had stung <span class="sc">Eglantine's</span> goat to death, killed her
pet dog, and so tortured a brood of chickens belonging to her
widowed mother, that they had imagined themselves to be ducklings
and were drowned in a pond.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 400px;"><a href="images/216-980.png"><img src="images/216-400.png" width="400" height="310" alt="'Here we are again!'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Here we are again!"</p></div>

<p>These troubles caused great grief to <span class="sc">Eglantine</span> and her parent,
and ruin stared them in the face; and, when ruin stares, there is
not often a back way out of the difficulty. Very sad, therefore, was
the poor girl as she approached the place of <span class="sc">Kipper's</span> disaster. But
directly she saw what had happened she forgot all her own troubles,
and, with many words of pity, extricated the stagbeetle from the
stones. The insect was so pleased, that he wished to embrace her:
but stagbeetles kiss, like Laplanders, by rubbing noses; so <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>
declined the offer, and hurried to pick up the luckless <span class="sc">Kipper</span>,
with whom she had a bowing acquaintance. In her case, therefore,
familiarity had never bred contempt for his sulky ways. She was
really sorry to see the poor fellow in such dreadful plight, and took
him up, as tenderly as she would have a butterfly with a broken leg.
Then she laid him on the soft grass, and sent the stagbeetle to
get some wild mint while she loosened his waistcoat, and gently
fanned his face with a dock-leaf. When the mint arrived, she
crushed the fragrant leaves between her fingers, and made him
inhale the scent, still keeping up
the fanning.</p>

<p>In two or three minutes <span class="sc">Kipper</span>
gave two or three sobs, shook himself
like a dog who has been in the
water, and, sitting up, opened his
eyes, and exclaimed, "Here we
are again!" He had come to himself,
for he could have gone to
nobody else. Then he looked at
<span class="sc">Eglantine</span> with a curious sort of
smile, which made her blush, and
cried, "So you have saved my life.
What reward do you expect?"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Eglantine</span> blushed again, and
the stagbeetle gave his master a
gentle pinch and whispered that
there had been no time to advertise
their misfortune in the <i>Gossamer
Gazette</i>, which is the official organ
of Fairydom. <span class="sc">Kipper</span> took the
hint and in a milder tone said,
"Well, <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>, you have done
me a good turn. Why did you do
so?" "O! Mr. <span class="sc">Kipper</span>," replied
the maiden; "was it not my duty?"
"It is a bad habit," replied the goblin, "to try and answer
one question with another, but it is an excellent but rare custom to

Think before you answer." "Why should I," said <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>;
"are you not a fellow-creature?" "A fellow-creature!" screamed
<span class="sc">Kipper</span>. "Don't you know that I am a goblin, a mischievous
goblin, a good-for-nothing goblin?" "O! no," answered <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>,
simply; "I only know that you have the right to be made
happy, as has every creature on earth." <span class="sc">Kipper</span> leapt to his feet.
His queer little face seemed suddenly freed from wrinkles, there was
something like a dew drop in each corner of his eyes. "Why,
<span class="sc">Eglantine</span>," he shouted; "you are a perfect &mdash;&mdash;" It has never
been known whether he would have added "donkey" or "angel,"
because at this minute a fierce trumpeting rent the air, <span class="sc">Eglantine</span>
shrieked, the stagbeetle quivered, even <span class="sc">Kipper</span> turned pale, for
just above them hovered a great tawny and black creature, with
fierce hate in its glowing eyes: in short, <span class="sc">Nippard</span> the Terror of the
Forest!</p>

<span class="sc">Scene</span>&mdash;<i>A corridor in the Royal Courts.</i> Eminent Counsel <i>in conversation
with</i> Estimable Solicitor <i>and</i> Respected Client.
</p></blockquote>

<p><i>Client.</i> I am rather sorry, Sir, that you could not conduct my case
in person.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> So am I. I took a deal of trouble in preparing the argument
I proposed to advance, and it was a great disappointment to me
that I was unable to deliver it in person.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> But your junior, Sir, represented you to perfection.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> I am rejoiced to hear it. I give every credit to my young
and learned friend, and am pleased to think that when we met in
consultation I was able to choose the right line of policy.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Besides, if you were not with us, your retainer prevented you
from being against us. And that was a distinct advantage.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> You are most flattering, and too kind.</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Not at all; and I am sure my client agrees with me?</p>

<p><i>Client.</i> Well, of course I would rather have had the assistance of
silk, although your junior no doubt did his best.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> I am sure he did. And now, gentlemen, is there anything
further I can do for you?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Thank you very much&mdash;I think not. You got up your case,
consulted with your junior, and if you were prevented from putting
in an appearance in the Court itself, were there in spirit. Besides, I
repeat it was a good thing for us that you did not join the Bar of the
other side. Thank you very much indeed, Sir. Good day.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> Good day. (<i>He prepares to walk off, when, noticing a
movement of the solicitor, he stops.</i>) You are sure I can do nothing
more for you?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Oh, it's scarcely worth mentioning. But perhaps you
would not mind returning your fee.</p>

<p><i>Coun.</i> With the greatest pleasure! (<i>Hands over a bag of gold
and exit.</i>)</p>

<p><i>Client.</i> Well, really, that seems to me very generous! Isn't it
rather unusual?</p>

<p><i>Solic.</i> Unusual! Oh dear no! Why, it's the practice of the
whole profession!</p>
